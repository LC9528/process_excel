focus on xlsb and macro process

I try to use pandas to deal with my .xlsb file and insert certain value which is rate of KPI of country into my database. 
If you encounter same situation which you have to extract value of .xlsb file and insert into database, there you go.
In addition, I use mysql as my database.

All suggestions are welcome, thank you.
